# GPSd strange tools
Set of my gps python tools for use with gpsd. **Initial commit and WIP!!!**

## mysql stuff (WIP)
all it needs to have table sthn like:

```
create table gps(id int not null auto_increment primary key, timestamp timestamp, prn int(5), az int(5), el int(5), ss int(5), used tinyint(1));_
```

## matplotlib & graphs

It all uses very old python/matplotlib because of using it on very very old hardware incapable of anything newer than Debian Jessie
Hope to move into something newer in future but lack of job and money f#&s with my head.
